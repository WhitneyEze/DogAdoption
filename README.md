Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My web page contains a total of 4 pages and a CSS page style. All of them are connected and it can be accessed by the buttons on the navigation bar (which also contains a search placeholder) or the links on the side bar. All of them have meta tags including the viewport one. All of them contains a footer where you can found information as the address and  telephone number in case someone desires to contact us.
This web page consist on dogÂ´s adoption.

Firstly, Mentioning that the stylesheet, a CSS file, contains the basic style of the 4 pages. Here, it can also be found .scss syntax. It has id selectors, tag selectors, class selectors and 1 pseudo-selector. At the same time, everyone of these pages has more specific style on them.

Secondly, the main page, name index; also contains responsive design where the table of content does not print in case someone prints that page. Through out this table of contents somebody can go to different sections on the same web page. It also contains a child selector, an image and an unordered list. This page contains a comment section.

Furthermore, the web page where it can find some more pictures about the dogs we have at our centre at the moment. These images are displayed on grid way and if the web page gets small, the columns contract until having just one column. The images have also effect when the cursor touch them to make them bigger and have a better view of them.

Now, continuing with the care page, to simplify the design it finds a link to an external webpage where somebody can find some tips on how to take care of a dog at home.

Finally, at the last webpage it can be found a little explanation of who we are.
